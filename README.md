# FAC19 Projects Gallery

A site for showcasing the wonderful projects created by FAC19, the 19th Cohort of Founders and Coders.

In weeks 1-8 we build projects in teams of 4 in a day and a half, followed by code review and presentations to the rest of the cohort about our approach, challenges encountered and what we learnt! The second half of the course is dedicated to two longer projects - each of which consists of a design sprint and two build sprints.

## Updating and maintaining this repo

This repo is a space for FAC19 to host the projects each team creates each week. It is up to you how you'd like to keep this site maintained and how you'd like to lay it out and design it!
